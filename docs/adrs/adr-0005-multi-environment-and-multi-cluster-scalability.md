# ADR-0005: Multi-Environment and Multi-Cluster Scalability

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The logging stack must support deployment across multiple environments (dev, staging, production) and potentially across multiple OpenShift clusters. Each environment may have different scaling, retention, and compliance requirements. The architecture should enable environment-specific configuration, isolation, and automated promotion of changes via GitOps workflows.

## Decision
Adopt a multi-environment GitOps structure using overlays and Kustomize. Each environment (dev, staging, prod) will have its own overlay, with shared base configurations. For multi-cluster scenarios, use ArgoCD ApplicationSets or similar tools to automate deployment and promotion across clusters. Enforce environment isolation and enable automated, auditable promotion of changes.

## Consequences
- Enables environment-specific configuration and isolation
- Simplifies promotion and rollback of changes
- Increases complexity of GitOps repository structure
- Requires careful management of overlays and ApplicationSets

## Alternatives Considered
- Single environment configuration
- Manual promotion and deployment

## Supporting Evidence
- Kustomize and overlays in repo structure
- ArgoCD documentation: ApplicationSets
- OpenShift docs: multi-cluster management
