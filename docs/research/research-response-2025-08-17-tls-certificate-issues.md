An In-Depth Analysis of TLS Integration Failures in a GitOps-Managed OpenShift Logging StackThe Anatomy of a Secure Log Forwarding ConnectionThe successful forwarding of logs over a secure channel in a modern, cloud-native environment is predicated on a robust and correctly configured Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). When integrating components like the OpenShift Logging Operator, the Vector log collector, Cert Manager, and ArgoCD, a failure in Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate verification often points to a misunderstanding of these fundamental principles within the Kubernetes context. This section deconstructs the core components of a secure connection to establish a clear foundation for diagnosing and resolving complex integration failures.Deconstructing the TLS Handshake in the OpenShift Logging ContextIn the OpenShift Logging 6.3 architecture, the Vector collector, deployed as a DaemonSet on each node, acts as the TLS client. Its responsibility is to initiate a secure connection to a log aggregation endpoint, which functions as the TLS server.1 This endpoint could be an in-cluster service like a LokiStack gateway or an external system such as a secure syslog receiver or an Elasticsearch cluster.3 The TLS handshake, the protocol used to establish this secure session, can operate in two primary modes relevant to this architecture.Server Authentication: This is the most common and fundamental mode of TLS. The client (Vector) authenticates the identity of the server (the log endpoint). During the handshake, the server presents its digital certificate to the client. The client then verifies this certificate by checking its validity (e.g., expiry date, hostname) and, most critically, by confirming that it was signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) that the client trusts. Within the OpenShift ClusterLogForwarder custom resource, specifying an output URL with a secure scheme such as https, tls, or udps implicitly enables this server-side authentication.3Mutual Authentication (mTLS): This mode provides a higher level of security by adding a second layer of verification: the server also authenticates the identity of the client. After the client has verified the server's certificate, the server requests a certificate from the client. The client (Vector) presents its own certificate and private key, which the server then validates against its own list of trusted CAs. This ensures that only authorized and identifiable log collectors can forward data to the endpoint. The OpenShift Logging framework enables mTLS when the secret referenced by a secure output contains specific keys for a client certificate (tls.crt) and a client private key (tls.key).3 A failure in this process can manifest as a remote error: tls: certificate required if the client fails to present the required credentials.6The Certificate Chain of Trust: From Root CA to Service EndpointThe concept of a "chain of trust" is central to understanding and resolving TLS verification failures. A digital certificate is not inherently trustworthy on its own; its trustworthiness is derived from the entity that signed it. This forms a hierarchical chain:Root CA Certificate: This is a self-signed certificate that forms the anchor of trust for the entire PKI. The public key of the Root CA is pre-distributed to clients and placed in their "trust stores." For an internal PKI managed by Cert Manager, this Root CA is the ultimate authority created during the bootstrapping process.7Intermediate CA Certificate(s) (Optional): For security and administrative purposes, a Root CA rarely signs end-entity certificates directly. Instead, it signs certificates for one or more Intermediate CAs. These intermediates can then sign other certificates. This practice limits the exposure of the Root CA's private key.End-Entity (or Leaf) Certificate: This is the certificate presented by the TLS server (e.g., the LokiStack gateway). It is signed by either an Intermediate CA or, in simpler setups, directly by the Root CA.For a TLS client like Vector to successfully verify the server's certificate, it must be able to construct an unbroken path from the end-entity certificate all the way back to a trusted Root CA certificate in its trust store. The server typically aids this process by sending not just its own certificate but also any necessary intermediate certificates. If the client cannot find a trusted root that anchors this chain, the verification fails, resulting in the common and often perplexing error: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority.9 This error signifies that while the certificate itself may be syntactically valid, the client has no basis for trusting its issuer.Dissecting the Kubernetes TLS Secret: The Roles of tls.crt, tls.key, and ca-bundle.crtA significant source of configuration error stems from the misinterpretation of the data keys within the Kubernetes Secret resource used by the ClusterLogForwarder. While Kubernetes has a standard kubernetes.io/tls secret type, the ClusterLogForwarder API uses the keys for its own specific purposes, which can differ from their conventional roles.tls.crt and tls.key: This is a standard public certificate and private key pair. In the context of a ClusterLogForwarder output secret, these keys represent the client's identity. They are used exclusively for enabling mutual TLS (mTLS), where Vector must present its own certificate to the server for authentication.3 This contrasts with the typical use in an Ingress, where tls.crt and tls.key represent the server's identity. This distinction is critical; placing the server's certificate and key in these fields for a ClusterLogForwarder output will not help with server verification and is an incorrect configuration for standard TLS.ca-bundle.crt: This key is specifically designated by the OpenShift Logging API to serve as the trust store for the TLS client (Vector).3 Its value must be a PEM-encoded bundle of one or more CA certificates that Vector should trust. To resolve a certificate signed by unknown authority error when connecting to a service signed by an internal PKI, the public certificate of the internal Root CA must be placed in this bundle.11ca.crt: This key is often found in secrets generated by Cert Manager when it issues a certificate.7 It typically contains the public certificate of the specific CA that signed the certificate in tls.crt. While useful for applications that need to know their immediate issuer, it is not the key that the ClusterLogForwarder API specifically looks for to populate the client's trust store. The ca-bundle.crt key is the correct target for this purpose.The entire security model of the log forwarding pipeline relies on the correct assembly of this secret. The Logging Operator does not perform TLS validation itself; it simply takes the data from the specified secret, mounts it into the Vector collector pods, and configures the Vector process to use those files. A mistake in the secret's content or structure leads directly to a runtime failure within the collector pod.Configuring the ClusterLogForwarder for Secure EndpointsThe ClusterLogForwarder custom resource is the primary interface for administrators to declaratively manage log forwarding in OpenShift Logging 6.3. Its API provides the necessary controls to configure secure, TLS-encrypted outputs. A precise understanding of this API is essential for successful integration with services secured by custom or internal certificate authorities.API Evolution: logging.openshift.io/v1 vs. observability.openshift.io/v1With the release of OpenShift Logging version 6, the API group for the ClusterLogForwarder resource was migrated. Older versions of OpenShift Logging and their documentation refer to the API logging.openshift.io/v1.5 However, starting with Logging 6.0 and continuing in 6.3, the canonical API version is observability.openshift.io/v1.15This is not merely a cosmetic change; the new API group introduces an updated schema and capabilities, including more advanced filtering and routing options. For any configuration targeting OpenShift Logging 6.3, it is imperative to use apiVersion: observability.openshift.io/v1. Using the legacy API version may result in configuration being ignored, validation errors, or unexpected behavior, as the Cluster Logging Operator is designed to reconcile resources against the newer API definition.The outputs.secret Stanza: A Definitive GuideThe spec.outputs array in the ClusterLogForwarder CR defines the destinations for log data. When an output requires a secure connection, the secret field within its definition becomes the central point of configuration for all TLS-related parameters.3 This field references a Kubernetes Secret that must exist in the openshift-logging namespace.5The behavior of the TLS connection is determined by the keys present within this referenced secret:Server Authentication (Standard TLS)This is the configuration required for Vector to validate the identity of the remote log server.url: The URL of the output endpoint must use a secure protocol prefix, such as https:// or tls://. This signals to the operator that a TLS connection is required.3secret.name: This field specifies the name of the Kubernetes Secret containing the necessary TLS assets.Required Key in Secret: The secret must contain a data key named ca-bundle.crt. The value of this key must be the PEM-encoded public certificate of the Certificate Authority (or a bundle of CAs) that signed the server's certificate. This is the trust anchor that Vector will use for verification.5Mutual Authentication (mTLS)This configuration builds upon server authentication by also providing client credentials for Vector to present to the server.All requirements for Server Authentication must be met. This includes a secure url and a secret containing a valid ca-bundle.crt.Additional Keys in Secret: The same secret must also contain the following two data keys:tls.crt: The PEM-encoded public certificate for the client (Vector).tls.key: The PEM-encoded private key corresponding to the client certificate.3It is a configuration error to provide a secret with tls.crt and tls.key if the url is not a secure scheme, and the operator's validation logic will typically reject such a configuration.3Configuration Patterns and Complete YAML ExamplesApplying these principles, the following examples demonstrate complete and valid configurations for common log forwarding scenarios.Example 1: Forwarding to an Internal LokiStack with a Custom CAThis scenario is representative of the user's query, where logs are forwarded to an in-cluster LokiStack service that is secured by a certificate from an internal PKI (e.g., managed by Cert Manager).First, a secret must be created in the openshift-logging namespace containing the Root CA of the internal PKI.YAMLapiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: lokistack-ca-bundle
  namespace: openshift-logging
type: Opaque
data:
  # This value must be the base64-encoded PEM of the internal Root CA certificate.
  ca-bundle.crt: LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBDRVJUSUZJQ0FURS0tLS0tCk1JSUV...
Next, the ClusterLogForwarder is configured to use this secret for server verification.YAMLapiVersion: observability.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterLogForwarder
metadata:
  name: instance
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
  serviceAccount:
    name: collector # The service account for the collector [19]
  outputs:

      type: loki
      # The URL points to the LokiStack gateway service within the cluster.
      url: https://lokistack-dev-gateway-http.openshift-logging.svc:8080/api/logs/v1/application
      secret:
        # Reference the secret containing the custom CA bundle.
        name: lokistack-ca-bundle
  pipelines:
    - name: forward-app-logs-to-loki
      inputRefs:
        - application
      outputRefs:
        - loki-internal-secure
Example 2: Forwarding to an External Elasticsearch with mTLSThis example demonstrates a more complex configuration for sending logs to an external, mTLS-enabled Elasticsearch endpoint. This requires a secret containing the external service's CA bundle as well as a client certificate/key pair for Vector.YAMLapiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: external-es-mtls
  namespace: openshift-logging
type: Opaque
data:
  # Base64-encoded CA bundle for validating the external Elasticsearch server.
  ca-bundle.crt: LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBDRVJUSUZJQ0FURS0tLS0tCk1JSUV...
  # Base64-encoded client certificate for Vector.
  tls.crt: LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBDRVJUSUZJQ0FURS0tLS0tCk1JSUM...
  # Base64-encoded client private key for Vector.
  tls.key: LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBQUklWQVRFIEtFWS0tLS0tCk1JSUR...
The ClusterLogForwarder then references this comprehensive secret.YAMLapiVersion: observability.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterLogForwarder
metadata:
  name: instance
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
  serviceAccount:
    name: collector
  outputs:

      type: elasticsearch
      url: https://elasticsearch.secure.com:9200

      inputRefs:
        - application
        - infrastructure
        - audit
      outputRefs:
        - elasticsearch-external-mtls
In both cases, the Cluster Logging Operator (CLO) is responsible for reconciling these resources. It parses the ClusterLogForwarder definition, identifies the referenced secret, and dynamically generates the appropriate configuration for the underlying Vector collector. This generated configuration includes mounting the secret as a volume into the Vector pods and directing Vector's TLS settings to use the file paths within that mounted volume. Therefore, a failure is not an issue with the CR itself but rather with how its contents are translated and consumed at runtime by the Vector process.Inside the Vector Collector: TLS Trust and VerificationWhile the ClusterLogForwarder custom resource provides the declarative interface for TLS configuration, the actual cryptographic operations and certificate validation are performed by the Vector log collector. Understanding how Vector handles TLS is crucial for diagnosing failures that originate at the transport layer. The OpenShift Logging Operator acts as a bridge, translating the high-level API objects into low-level configuration consumable by the Vector process running inside its container.Vector's Reliance on OpenSSL and System Trust StoresThe official Vector binaries are statically linked against a specific version of the OpenSSL library, meaning they do not use the OpenSSL library installed on the host operating system.20 This self-contained approach ensures consistent cryptographic behavior across different environments. By default, this embedded OpenSSL library searches for trusted CA certificates in a specific, hierarchical order:Environment Variables: The SSL_CERT_FILE environment variable can point to a single file containing a bundle of trusted CA certificates. The SSL_CERT_DIR variable can point to a directory containing multiple individual certificate files.20 These variables provide the most direct and explicit method for overriding the default trust store for the Vector process.Default System Locations: If the environment variables are not set, Vector leverages the openssl-probe Rust crate to search for CA bundles in common, OS-specific locations (e.g., /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt on Debian-based systems).20 This probing behavior can be disabled via the VECTOR_OPENSSL_NO_PROBE environment variable if necessary.20This behavior is fundamental to the problem at hand. For Vector to trust a certificate signed by a custom, internal CA, that CA's public certificate must be made available to the Vector process through one of these recognized mechanisms. Simply creating a ConfigMap or Secret in the cluster is insufficient; its data must be actively injected into the collector's runtime environment.How the Logging Operator Injects the Custom CA BundleThe OpenShift Logging Operator orchestrates the connection between the Kubernetes API and the Vector runtime. When a secret is defined in a ClusterLogForwarder output, the operator performs the following actions during its reconciliation loop:Volume Mounting: The operator modifies the DaemonSet definition for the Vector collector. It adds a volume that mounts the specified Kubernetes Secret (e.g., lokistack-ca-bundle) into the filesystem of each collector pod. This typically occurs at a well-known path, such as /var/run/secrets/collector-tls/<output-name>.Configuration Generation: The operator generates the Vector configuration file (e.g., vector.toml). Within the configuration for the specific output sink (e.g., [sinks.loki-internal-secure]), it sets the appropriate TLS option to point to the file within the mounted volume. For server verification, this would be the tls.ca_file option, configured with the path to the ca-bundle.crt file from the mounted secret.This mechanism effectively translates the abstract secretName reference from the ClusterLogForwarder CR into a concrete file path that the Vector process can use to initialize its OpenSSL context, thereby loading the custom CA into its trust store for that specific output connection.Diagnosing TLS Failures from Vector Pod LogsThe most direct source of information for diagnosing TLS connection failures is the log output from the Vector container itself. To access these logs, an administrator should first identify the collector pods and then stream their logs.Find Collector Pods:Bashoc get pods -n openshift-logging -l component=collector
Inspect Logs:Bashoc logs <vector-pod-name> -c vector -n openshift-logging
Within these logs, specific error messages provide clear indicators of the nature of the failure:ERROR vector::sinks::util::tls: TLS handshake failed. error="invalid certificate: unknown issuer" or certificate signed by unknown authority: This is the canonical error indicating that the server presented a certificate signed by a CA that is not in Vector's trust store for this connection. The root cause is an incorrect or incomplete ca-bundle.crt file.ERROR...: TLS handshake failed. error="invalid certificate: cert not valid for passed hostname": This indicates a hostname mismatch. The url specified in the ClusterLogForwarder output does not match any of the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) or Common Name (CN) fields in the server's certificate.ERROR...: TLS handshake failed. error="invalid certificate: expired": The server's certificate has expired.Connection refused: This is typically a network-level error, not a TLS error. It suggests that a NetworkPolicy is blocking the connection from the collector pod to the destination IP and port, or the server process is not running.Critical Constraint: FIPS ModeA crucial and often overlooked constraint is the compatibility of Vector with clusters operating in Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) mode. The documentation and community resources explicitly state that Vector, as packaged in OpenShift Logging, does not support FIPS-enabled clusters.4If an OpenShift cluster is installed with FIPS mode enabled, it enforces the use of FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules for all core components. The statically linked OpenSSL library within the Vector container provided by the Logging Operator is not FIPS-validated. Attempting to run this stack in a FIPS environment is an unsupported configuration and may lead to unpredictable failures, including the inability to perform any TLS handshakes. Administrators must verify the FIPS status of their cluster as a preliminary step in troubleshooting. This can be checked by inspecting the cluster version object or the status of the nodes.Automating Certificate Lifecycles with Cert ManagerIn a dynamic Kubernetes environment, manual management of TLS certificates is untenable. Cert Manager is the de facto standard for automating the lifecycle of certificates, from issuance and renewal to storage in Kubernetes Secrets. When forwarding logs to internal services, Cert Manager can be used to establish a complete internal PKI, ensuring that all endpoints are secured with valid, trusted certificates. Correctly configuring this PKI and integrating it with the OpenShift Logging stack is a multi-step process that forms the foundation of a secure and automated observability pipeline.Establishing an Internal PKI: The Bootstrapping ProcessCreating a private Certificate Authority with Cert Manager involves a sequence of declarative resource definitions that build upon one another to establish a root of trust.Step 1: Create a SelfSigned ClusterIssuerThe process begins by creating a ClusterIssuer that can sign certificates for itself. This special-purpose issuer acts as the genesis block for the PKI. It requires no external dependencies or credentials.YAMLapiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: selfsigned-ca-issuer
spec:
  selfSigned: {}
This resource provides the capability to generate a self-signed Root CA certificate.8Step 2: Create a Root CA CertificateNext, a Certificate custom resource is created to request the Root CA certificate. This resource uses the selfsigned-ca-issuer to sign itself. Key fields in this specification are isCA: true, which adds the necessary basicConstraints extension to the certificate, and secretName, which defines the Secret where the resulting certificate and private key will be stored.8YAMLapiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: internal-root-ca
  # The secret must be stored in the cluster resource namespace for a ClusterIssuer.
  # By default, this is the 'cert-manager' namespace.
  namespace: cert-manager
spec:
  isCA: true
  commonName: internal-root-ca
  secretName: internal-root-ca-secret
  privateKey:
    algorithm: ECDSA
    size: 256
  issuerRef:
    name: selfsigned-ca-issuer
    kind: ClusterIssuer
    group: cert-manager.io
Upon reconciliation, Cert Manager will create a Secret named internal-root-ca-secret in the cert-manager namespace containing tls.crt (the Root CA's public certificate) and tls.key (the Root CA's private key).Step 3: Create the CA ClusterIssuerWith the Root CA's key pair securely stored in a Secret, the primary ClusterIssuer for the internal PKI can be created. This issuer is of type ca and is configured to sign new certificate requests using the private key from the internal-root-ca-secret.7YAMLapiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: internal-ca-issuer
spec:
  ca:
    # This references the secret containing the Root CA keypair.
    secretName: internal-root-ca-secret
This internal-ca-issuer is now ready to issue trusted certificates for any service within the cluster.Issuing Certificates for Log Forwarding EndpointsTo secure a log forwarding endpoint like the LokiStack gateway, another Certificate resource is required. This resource requests a standard end-entity certificate, specifying the DNS names the certificate should be valid for. It references the internal-ca-issuer created in the previous step.YAMLapiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: lokistack-gateway-tls
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
  secretName: lokistack-gateway-tls-secret
  duration: 2160h # 90d
  renewBefore: 360h # 15d
  issuerRef:
    name: internal-ca-issuer
    kind: ClusterIssuer
  dnsNames:
    - lokistack-dev-gateway-http.openshift-logging.svc
    - lokistack-dev-gateway-http.openshift-logging.svc.cluster.local
Cert Manager will process this request, have it signed by the internal-ca-issuer, and store the resulting certificate, private key, and the signing CA's certificate in a Secret named lokistack-gateway-tls-secret in the openshift-logging namespace. The LokiStack component would then be configured to use this secret for its TLS termination.23Assembling the ca-bundle.crt for the ClusterLogForwarderThis is the final and most critical step in connecting the PKI to the log forwarding configuration, and it is a frequent point of failure. The ClusterLogForwarder's Vector client does not need the server's certificate (lokistack-gateway-tls-secret) for its trust store; it needs the certificate of the Root CA that ultimately anchors the trust chain.A common mistake is to point the ClusterLogForwarder's secret.name to the secret generated for the service (lokistack-gateway-tls-secret). This will fail because that secret's ca.crt contains the signing CA, but if there are intermediates or if the client needs the absolute root, the verification will fail.The correct approach is to create a dedicated Secret for the ClusterLogForwarder that contains the public certificate of the Root CA. The value for this secret's ca-bundle.crt key must be extracted from the tls.crt key of the internal-root-ca-secret.An administrator can create this secret declaratively or using CLI commands:Bash# Extract the Root CA public certificate and create the required secret for the CLF.
oc get secret internal-root-ca-secret -n cert-manager -o jsonpath='{.data.tls\.crt}' | base64 -d > internal-root-ca.pem

oc create secret generic clf-trust-bundle -n openshift-logging \
  --from-file=ca-bundle.crt=internal-root-ca.pem
The ClusterLogForwarder output configuration can then correctly reference clf-trust-bundle. This explicitly provides Vector with the ultimate root of trust for the entire internal PKI, enabling it to successfully validate the certificate presented by the LokiStack gateway and resolving the unknown authority error.The GitOps Dimension: Coexistence with ArgoCDManaging a complex, multi-component stack like OpenShift Logging and Cert Manager with a GitOps tool such as ArgoCD introduces a unique set of challenges. The core principle of GitOps is that the Git repository is the single source of truth for the desired state of the cluster.24 However, operators like Cert Manager are designed to actively mutate the state of resources within the cluster, creating a natural and expected conflict with this declarative model. Resolving this conflict is key to maintaining a healthy and manageable GitOps workflow.The OutOfSync Challenge: Git vs. The Operator PatternThe primary manifestation of this conflict is the OutOfSync status in ArgoCD.26 This status arises when the live state of a resource in the Kubernetes cluster differs from the state defined in the Git repository. When Cert Manager issues or renews a certificate, it updates the data field of the corresponding Secret resource with the new certificate and private key. ArgoCD's diffing mechanism detects this change and, because the new data does not exist in Git, correctly flags the Secret as OutOfSync.28Similarly, many operators, including the Cluster Logging Operator and Cert Manager, write operational status, conditions, and other metadata into the status subresource of their CRs. This information is not, and should not be, stored in Git. ArgoCD will also detect these differences and report an OutOfSync condition. This behavior is not an error but a fundamental consequence of how these systems interact. Attempting to "fix" it by committing the dynamically generated secret data or status fields back to Git is an anti-pattern that breaks the automation provided by the operators and introduces significant security risks.Strategic Application of ignoreDifferencesThe canonical solution to this challenge is to instruct ArgoCD to intelligently ignore specific, expected differences using the ignoreDifferences feature in the Application spec or the system-wide argocd-cm ConfigMap.26 This feature allows for granular control over the diffing process, enabling a harmonious coexistence between the declarative state in Git and the dynamic, operational state managed by in-cluster controllers.Ignoring Certificate Data in SecretsFor Secret resources managed by Cert Manager, the entire data field should be ignored. The source of truth for the certificate data is Cert Manager itself, not Git. Git should only define the secret's existence, name, and metadata.YAML# In the ArgoCD Application spec
spec:
  ignoreDifferences:
  - group: ""
    kind: Secret
    # Be specific to the secret managed by Cert Manager
    name: lokistack-gateway-tls-secret
    namespace: openshift-logging
    # Ignore all keys within the 'data' field
    jsonPointers:
    - /data
Ignoring Status Fields on Custom ResourcesThe status subresource of any CR managed by an operator should almost always be ignored. The controller in the cluster is the sole owner of this field.YAML# In the ArgoCD Application spec
spec:
  ignoreDifferences:
  # Ignore status for Cert Manager Certificate resources
  - group: cert-manager.io
    kind: Certificate
    jsonPointers:
    - /status
  # Ignore status for ClusterLogForwarder resources
  - group: observability.openshift.io
    kind: ClusterLogForwarder
    jsonPointers:
    - /status
A more general approach can be configured system-wide in the argocd-cm ConfigMap to ignore the status field for all resources, which is a common and recommended practice.27YAMLdata:
  resource.compareoptions: |
    ignoreResourceStatusField: all
By applying these configurations, ArgoCD will no longer flag expected, operator-driven changes as drift. The application will remain in a Synced state, while still managing the core configuration from Git and allowing the in-cluster controllers to perform their designated functions.Best Practices for Repository StructureTo effectively manage the various components of the observability stack within a GitOps framework, a structured repository layout is essential. The "App of Apps" pattern is a highly recommended approach for this purpose.29 This pattern involves a top-level ArgoCD Application that, instead of deploying workloads directly, deploys other ArgoCD Application resources.This creates a hierarchical structure that separates concerns and allows for independent lifecycle management:Operators Application: An Application responsible for deploying the core operators themselves, such as the OpenShift GitOps Operator (which provides ArgoCD), the OpenShift Logging Operator, the Loki Operator, and Cert Manager. These are foundational components that change infrequently.30Platform Configuration Application: An Application that deploys cluster-wide configuration resources. This is where ClusterIssuer resources for Cert Manager and other platform-level settings would reside.Observability Application: A dedicated Application for deploying the specific instances of the observability stack, including the ClusterLogging CR, the LokiStack CR, and the ClusterLogForwarder CRs. This application would also manage the Certificate resources needed for the logging endpoints and the Secret resources containing custom CA bundles.This separation ensures that a change to a log forwarding pipeline does not require reconciling the Cert Manager operator itself. It aligns with microservices principles, making the system more modular, scalable, and easier to manage.A Unified Troubleshooting FrameworkTroubleshooting TLS verification failures in this integrated stack requires a systematic approach that spans multiple domains: PKI, Kubernetes resource management, application runtime behavior, and network connectivity. A random or unstructured approach can be time-consuming and ineffective. The following framework provides a logical, multi-layer process for isolating and resolving the root cause of the issue.A Systematic, Multi-Layer Diagnostic ProcessThe diagnostic process should proceed from the most fundamental layer (the certificates themselves) up to the application and network layers.Validate the Certificate Chain (The PKI Layer): Before inspecting any Kubernetes resources, verify the integrity of the certificate chain itself. Obtain the PEM-encoded server certificate and the custom CA bundle. Use a tool like openssl on a local machine to confirm that the server certificate can be validated against the provided CA bundle. This step confirms that the cryptographic assets are correct and that the chain of trust is complete, independent of the Kubernetes environment.Inspect Kubernetes Resources (The API Layer): If the chain is valid, the next step is to ensure the correct certificates are deployed in the cluster.Check the status of the ClusterIssuer, Certificate, and CertificateRequest resources to ensure Cert Manager has successfully issued the certificates. Look for a Ready condition of True.Inspect the contents of all relevant Secrets using oc get secret <name> -o yaml. Verify that the data fields are populated and that the base64-decoded values correspond to the expected certificates and keys. Crucially, confirm that the ca-bundle.crt in the secret used by the ClusterLogForwarder contains the correct Root CA certificate.Analyze the Collector Pod (The Runtime Layer): The issue may lie in how the configuration is being consumed by the Vector process.exec into a running Vector collector pod (oc exec -it <pod-name> -n openshift-logging -- bash).Navigate to the directory where the TLS secret is mounted (e.g., /var/run/secrets/collector-tls/...). Verify that the ca-bundle.crt, tls.crt, and tls.key files exist and have the correct content.Examine the Vector pod's logs for specific TLS error messages, as detailed in Section 3.3.Test Connectivity from the Pod (The Network Layer): A TLS error can sometimes mask an underlying network issue. From within the Vector pod, use tools like curl or openssl s_client to attempt a direct connection to the log forwarding endpoint's service DNS name and port.A connection refused or no route to host error points to a NetworkPolicy issue or a problem with the server-side application, not a TLS verification failure.A successful connection using openssl s_client -connect <server>:<port> -CAfile <path/to/mounted/ca-bundle.crt> from inside the pod is the ultimate confirmation that the PKI assets and network path are correct, suggesting the issue may lie in the generated Vector configuration itself.The Diagnostic MatrixTo accelerate troubleshooting, the following matrix maps common symptoms (error messages) observed in the Vector pod logs to their most probable root causes within this specific technology stack and provides the precise commands needed for diagnosis.Error Message (in Vector logs)Likely Root CauseDiagnostic Command(s)Resolutionx509: certificate signed by unknown authorityThe ca-bundle.crt in the CLF secret does not contain the public certificate of the Root CA that signed the server's certificate.oc get secret <clf-secret> -n openshift-logging -o jsonpath='{.data.ca-bundle\.crt}' | base64 -d > bundle.crt

It acts as a generic TLS client and can be used to connect to any TLS-enabled endpoint to inspect the certificate it presents.Retrieve and Inspect the Server's Certificate Chain:Bash# The '-showcerts' flag displays the entire chain sent by the server.
openssl s_client -connect <hostname>:<port> -showcerts </dev/null
This command allows an administrator to capture the exact certificates being presented by the server for offline analysis with openssl x509 or for comparison against the Secret contents.Test Verification with a Specific CA Bundle:Bash# This command emulates exactly what Vector should be doing.
openssl s_client -connect <hostname>:<port> -CAfile /path/to/your/ca-bundle.crt
Running this command from within the Vector pod, using the path to the mounted ca-bundle.crt, is the most definitive test of the entire verification chain. A "Verify return code: 0 (ok)" indicates success, while any other code points directly to a problem with the certificate or the CA bundle.Advanced Strategies and Architectural RecommendationsSuccessfully resolving an immediate TLS verification issue is the first step. Operating a secure, reliable, and scalable observability stack in the long term requires addressing "day two" operational concerns, such as certificate lifecycle management, proactive monitoring, and architectural patterns that simplify management at scale. Adopting these advanced strategies transforms a reactive troubleshooting process into a robust, automated system.CA Lifecycle Management: Rotation and MonitoringBy establishing an internal PKI with Cert Manager, an organization assumes the responsibility for its entire lifecycle. The Root CA certificate, stored in the internal-root-ca-secret, has a finite lifespan (typically 1-10 years).32 If this root certificate expires, the entire chain of trust collapses, and all certificates it has signed will become invalid, leading to a catastrophic failure of all internal TLS communication.CA Rotation: Planning for the eventual rotation of the Root CA is a critical, albeit complex, operational task.33 This process is non-trivial and typically involves creating a new Root CA, cross-signing it with the old one, and gradually migrating services and trust stores to the new PKI before the old one expires.Proactive Monitoring: A more immediate and essential practice is to proactively monitor the expiration of all certificates managed by Cert Manager. Cert Manager exposes a rich set of Prometheus metrics that provide deep visibility into the health of the PKI.35 The most important metric is certmanager_certificate_ready_status, which indicates the status and remaining validity of each Certificate resource.A Prometheus alerting rule should be configured to provide ample warning before any certificate expires. This allows platform teams to investigate and resolve any renewal issues before they impact services.Example Prometheus Alert Rule:YAMLgroups:
- name: cert-manager.rules
  rules:
  - alert: CertManagerCertificateExpiresSoon
    # Fire if a certificate is ready but will expire in less than 30 days (2592000 seconds)
    expr: |
      certmanager_certificate_ready_status{condition="True"} == 1 and
      certmanager_certificate_expiration_timestamp_seconds - time() < 2592000
    for: 1h
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: Certificate expires soon
      description: 'The certificate {{ $labels.name }} in namespace {{ $labels.namespace }} is expiring in less than 30 days.'
This alert provides a critical safety net, ensuring that certificate renewal failures, which can be caused by misconfigurations, rate limiting, or backend issuer issues, are detected and addressed well in advance of their expiration.37Architectural Pattern: External Secrets OperatorAs an organization's Kubernetes footprint grows to multiple clusters, managing the distribution of shared secrets, such as the internal Root CA's public certificate, becomes a significant challenge. Manually creating the clf-trust-bundle secret on every cluster is error-prone and does not scale.The External Secrets Operator (ESO) provides an elegant, GitOps-native solution to this problem.39 ESO synchronizes secrets from an external provider (like AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or HashiCorp Vault) into Kubernetes Secrets.41The Centralized PKI Pattern:Management Cluster: A single, dedicated cluster runs Cert Manager. This cluster is responsible for the entire PKI lifecycle: creating the Root CA, managing the CA ClusterIssuer, and issuing all internal certificates.External Secret Store: When Cert Manager issues or renews a critical certificate (like the Root CA or a widely used wildcard certificate), a simple automation (e.g., a Kubernetes CronJob) pushes the contents of the corresponding Secret into a centralized, highly available secret store like HashiCorp Vault.Spoke Clusters: All other application clusters run the External Secrets Operator. They do not run their own instance of Cert Manager for the internal PKI.Secret Synchronization: On each spoke cluster, an ExternalSecret custom resource is deployed via GitOps. This resource instructs ESO to connect to the central Vault instance, retrieve the Root CA's public certificate, and create (or update) the local clf-trust-bundle Secret in the openshift-logging namespace.43This architecture offers substantial benefits:Centralized Control: PKI management is consolidated in one location, simplifying audits, rotation, and policy enforcement.Improved Security: The private key of the Root CA exists only on the management cluster, reducing its attack surface.Scalability: Onboarding a new cluster simply requires deploying ESO and the standard ExternalSecret manifest; no manual secret creation is needed.Consistency: All clusters are guaranteed to have the identical, up-to-date trust bundle, eliminating configuration drift as a source of TLS errors.By adopting these advanced strategies, organizations can move beyond simply fixing TLS errors to building a resilient, automated, and scalable infrastructure for secure communication across their entire Kubernetes estate.
